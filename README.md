# vBulBot

A relatively simple vBulletin spambot utilizing Python's Mechanize module. Once initiated it will select threads to spam randomly based on their thread ID.
It does so by means of a function that randomly generates a string of digits. The URL, generated digits and a string containing ".html" are
stored to a variable that is passed to a mechanized browser object that will open the randomly selected page and posts a predefined message.
After one operation is completed it will loop back to generate a new thread ID and start again. 

# Usage

To use the script you must first sign up for an account at the vBulletin based forum you intend to spam 
when you've done so you need to change the following values within the script:

```
br.open("http://www.exampleforums.org/forums/login.php?do=login")

br["vb_login_username"] = "username"
br["vb_login_password"] = "password"
```

To the URL of the target forum and the credentials of the account you set up. After that you need to change the value of the base URL:

```
random_url = "http://www.exampleforums.org/forums/operating-systems/linux-1" + digit_generator(5, "0987654321") + ".html"
```

Go to your target forum, open a thread and copy the URL to the first part of the string while leaving the thread ID off
so if you had a URL that looked like this:

```
http://www.exampleforums.org/forums/operating-systems/linux-173946.html
```
It should look like this when you paste it into the script:

```
http://www.exampleforums.org/forums/operating-systems/linux-1
```

If the forum you're targetting happens to have a lot less posts you can change the amount of digits to be generated by changing the argument "size"
that's passed to the digit generator function, to a lower amount.
 

# Note
The script isn't very user friendly, however i made it more or less as a personal side project. I may add some functionality that would 
make it easier to use. Such as commandline arguments that takes in the credentials for the spam account and total number of posts to 
be placed to give some more control over the program.
